## Overview

This project is my social links profile page that contains all my social links and other links that are relevant to my career. This is built using the mobile first approach. I also applied some hover effects on each link.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

For me to be able to follow the mobile first approach, I opened the dev tools and used the design toolbar at the top left of the dev tools and then scaled down the view to mobile size. From there, I started to code the project and when I am finished I scaled it up to tablet view and continue to scale it up to wider views until you are done building it with the desired screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced how to implement responsive design and the mobile first approach. I learned how to use media queries for creating responsive websites.

```
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {

        width: 456px;
        height: 611px;
    }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
    article {
        width: 384px;
